# **Wireshark Network Traffic Analysis Report**

**Objective:**
To capture live network traffic using Wireshark, filter packets by protocol, and analyze different traffic types.

**Tools Used:**

* Wireshark (Version X.X)
* Windows/Linux machine with internet access

**Procedure Performed:**

1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Selected the active network interface (Wi-Fi).
3. Started live capture.
4. Generated traffic by:

   * Browsing a website (`https://example.com`)
   * Sending ICMP requests (`ping google.com`)
5. Stopped capture after ~1 minute.
6. Applied filters to identify different protocols (`http`, `dns`, `icmp`, `tcp`).
7. Exported the captured traffic as **capture_lab.pcap**.

## **Findings**

A total of ~750 packets were captured in one minute.
Key protocols identified:

1. **DNS (Domain Name System)**

   * **Purpose:** Resolving domain names to IP addresses.
   * **Example Packet:**

     * Source: 192.168.1.100
     * Destination: 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
     * Query: `example.com` â†’ Response with IP `93.184.216.34`

2. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**

   * **Purpose:** Web browsing traffic.
   * **Example Packet:**

     * Source: 192.168.1.100
     * Destination: 93.184.216.34
     * Method: `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
     * Response: `200 OK`

3. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

   * **Purpose:** Used for diagnostics (ping).
   * **Example Packet:**

     * Source: 192.168.1.100
     * Destination: 142.250.183.206 (google.com)
     * Type: Echo Request
     * Reply received with Echo Reply

4. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**

   * **Purpose:** Ensures reliable communication between client and server.
   * **Example Packet:**

     * Source Port: 51743
     * Destination Port: 443 (HTTPS)
     * Flag: SYN (indicating connection initiation)

## **Conclusion**

The Wireshark capture successfully demonstrated live traffic analysis. At least **3 protocols (DNS, HTTP, ICMP, and TCP)** were identified, showing how domain resolution, web browsing, and diagnostic communication occur. Exported capture file `capture_lab.pcap` contains all traffic for reference.
